        <p class="text-sm leading-relaxed text-neutral-600 max-w-lg">
          This website is a quiet space for people who appreciate Japanese haiku
          and painting. It brings together short poems and visual works that
          focus on observation, restraint, and stillness.
          <br /><br />
          Each piece is selected for its simplicity and emotional clarity —
          nothing loud, nothing excessive. The intention is not to explain too
          much, but to leave room for interpretation.
          <br /><br />
          By allowing text and image to exist together without urgency, the site
          encourages a slower way of looking and reading — one that values
          pauses, silence, and attention.

          This project continues to grow as a shared archive of writing and
          visual expression. It exists for those who value simplicity,
          attentiveness, and quiet reflection.
          <br /><br />
          Contributions are shaped by care rather than speed, and by intention
          rather than volume. Each work is given space to exist on its own
          terms.
          <br /><br />
          If you are drawn to slowness, subtlety, and the quiet relationship
          between words and images, you are welcome here.
