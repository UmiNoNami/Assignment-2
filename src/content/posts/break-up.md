A break up is not loud.

It doesn’t always arrive with shouting, accusations, or dramatic exits.  
Sometimes it comes silently, like a room slowly losing its warmth.

You wake up and realise there is no one to tell your dreams to.  
You make coffee for one.  
You learn how heavy silence can be.

But somewhere in that silence, you begin to hear yourself again.
